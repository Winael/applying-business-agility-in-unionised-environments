## 05 — CONCLUSION

> “There’s no need for unionised workforces to fear business agility. Agile principles don’t clash with union values.“

Businesses and employees that have adopted business agility find themselves more able to adapt to changing market conditions and customer needs, but that doesn’t make implementation in unionised environments a simple task. Existing prejudices, misconceptions, fixed mindsets, and legislative requirements can slow or even stall business agility transformations completely, especially in a heavily unionised organisation that is already hostile towards attempts to streamline the workforce.

Agile values the individual over the process, and encourages experimentation, reflection and iteration over rigid rules and structures. Those same values and principles apply equally to the implementation of business agility as they do to working on projects in an agile environment. As such, implementation can occur in stages, through collaborative efforts, and expanded outward from small test teams to a larger workforce.

There’s no need for unionised workforces to fear business agility. Business agility principles don’t clash with union values. If we train ourselves to see unions as allies and roadblocks as potential opportunities, these values and principles will soon find a home in new work environments. Employees will have fresh opportunities to work side by side with unions and employers to find mutually satisfying solutions. Unions can reestablish strong bonds of trust with both employers and the larger workforce.

We’re not saying it’ll be a simple process. Change rarely is. But with transparency, consultation, and an iterative approach, business agility values and principles can enhance the self-determination and self-worth of every unionised employee.
